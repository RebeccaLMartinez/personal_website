:::{#hero-heading}

Hi! I’m Rebecca — a Marine Corps veteran, mom of two, and Environmental Studies major at UCSB. I didn’t take the usual path to college, but I’ve made every step count. I love working outside, solving real-world problems, and giving back through service and mentorship.

## 🛤️ My Path

After years of working, raising two amazing teens, and serving in the Marine Corps Reserves, I returned to school to study environmental systems and sustainability. I’m currently majoring in Environmental Studies at UCSB, where I’m combining [fieldwork and research](projects.qmd), along with community service, into a path that feels meaningful and practical.

## 👩‍👧‍👦😺 Family & Life

I’m a proud mom to two incredible teenagers. They've grown up alongside my journey, and honestly, they’re my biggest motivation. Outside of school, I love volunteering, spending time in nature, and hanging out with my cats, Chester and Leo.

## 🌿 Fieldwork Adventures

Some of my favorite days have been in the field — whether hiking through Sedgwick Reserve, working on a fog harp at Santa Cruz Island, or collecting water samples in Panama. These experiences remind me why I chose this path.

## ❤️ Work That Matters

Community connection is at the heart of everything I do — whether it’s through volunteer work, environmental research, or supporting fellow students and veterans. I believe that science and service go hand in hand, and that meaningful change starts with care, curiosity, and showing up for others in practical ways.
