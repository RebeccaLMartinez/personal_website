Hi! I'm Rebecca — an Environmental Studies major at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), student researcher, and mom of two incredible teenagers. I’ve taken an unconventional path to college, but I’ve made every step count. I’m drawn to work that’s hands-on, community-centered, and rooted in care — whether that’s in the field, the classroom, or beyond.

Right now, I’m focused on environmental research, mentorship, and exploring how undergraduate education can connect science, service, and real-world impact.

## 🛤️ My Path

Before returning to school, I spent about two decades working, raising my family as well as serving 5 years in the Marine Corps Reserves. Community college helped me rediscover my interest in science and service. Now, as an Environmental Studies student at UCSB, I hope to blend research, education, and community work into a path that feels useful and rewarding.

## 👩‍👧‍👦😺 Family & Life

I’m a proud mom to two incredible teenagers. They've grown up alongside my journey and they’re my biggest motivation. When I’m not studying or working, I like volunteering, being outdoors, and spending time with my cats, Chester and Leo.

## 🌿 Fieldwork Adventures

I learn best by doing, especially outdoors. Fieldwork helps me connect what I study with real ecosystems and real people. I think hands-on experience is one of the best ways to inspire students and communities who might not yet see themselves in science.

## ❤️ Work That Matters

Giving back to the community has always been important to me. Whether mentoring, volunteering, or helping behind the scenes, I try to contribute where I can. Over the years, I’ve been involved with groups like Toys for Tots, local outreach, and *She Raised Her Hand*.

To me, meaningful work is about showing up — and trusting that what we offer contributes to something bigger than ourselves.
