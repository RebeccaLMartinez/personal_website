Hi! I'm Rebecca ‚Äî an Environmental Studies major at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), student researcher, and mom of two incredible teenagers. I‚Äôve taken an unconventional path to college, but every step has shaped who I am today. I‚Äôm passionate about hands-on learning and finding meaningful ways to connect science with the world around us.

# üõ§Ô∏è My Path

Before returning to school, I balanced work, family life, and five years serving in the Marine Corps Reserves. Community college rekindled my love for science and service. At Allan Hancock College, I worked as a tutor and mentor, helping other students as I grew in my own studies. Now at UCSB, I‚Äôm blending research, education, and community involvement to build a path that feels purposeful and rewarding.

# üåø Learning by Doing


Sometimes the best way to learn is by jumping in and experiencing it firsthand. Fieldwork brings my studies to life by connecting science with real environments and showing how those environments impact our world. I believe hands-on experience is one of the best ways to inspire students and anyone who‚Äôs still finding their place in science.

# üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Life & Inspiration

I‚Äôm a proud mom of two amazing teenagers who inspire me every day. When I‚Äôm not studying or working, I enjoy volunteering, spending time outdoors, and relaxing with my cats, Chester and Leo.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Giving Back

Giving back has always been a priority for me. Whether mentoring, volunteering, or supporting community efforts behind the scenes, I believe showing up and contributing makes a difference. Over the years, I‚Äôve been involved with groups like Toys for Tots, local outreach, and *She Raised Her Hand*.

<div class="image-grid">
  <figure class="image-tile" onclick="openModal('/media/toysfortots.jpg', 'Toys for Tots Event (holding the unicorn).')">
    <img src="/media/toysfortots.jpg" alt="Toys for Tots">

*Please visit [**She Raised Her Hand**](https://www.sheraisedherhand.com) for more information and upcoming events.*  
*If you‚Äôd like to support seasonal giving efforts, donations can be made through [**Toys for Tots**](https://www.toysfortots.org).*
