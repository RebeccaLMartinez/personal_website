:::{#hero-heading}

Hi! I'm Rebecca — a mom of two, Environmental Studies major at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and Marine Corps veteran. I’ve taken an unconventional path to college, but I’ve made every step count. I’m drawn to work that’s hands-on, community-centered, and rooted in care — whether that’s in the field, the classroom, or beyond.

Right now, I’m focused on environmental research, mentorship, and exploring how undergraduate education can connect science, service, and real-world impact.

## 🛤️ My Path

Before returning to school, I spent two decades working, raising two kids, and serving in the Marine Corps Reserves. I began my academic journey at community college, where I rediscovered my passion for science and service. Now, as an Environmental Studies major at UCSB, I’m combining research, education, and community engagement into a path that feels both meaningful and practical.

## 👩‍👧‍👦😺 Family & Life

I’m a proud mom to two incredible teenagers. They've grown up alongside my journey, and honestly, they’re my biggest motivation. Outside of school, I love volunteering, spending time in nature, and hanging out with my cats, Chester and Leo.

## 🌿 Fieldwork Adventures

I’m happiest when I’m outside, learning by doing. Hands-on environmental work helps me connect what I’m learning in the classroom to real ecosystems and real people.
I believe fieldwork is one of the most powerful ways to teach and inspire others — especially students and community members who may not see themselves in science yet.

## ❤️ Work That Matters

Community involvement has always been a meaningful part of my life. Whether it’s through mentoring, volunteering, or helping behind the scenes, I try to contribute where I can — not because I have all the answers, but because I believe in being part of something that gives back. Over the years, I’ve stayed involved with efforts that reflect those values, like Toys for Tots, campus and local outreach, and *She Raised Her Hand*.

To me, meaningful work is about showing up — and trusting that what we offer contributes to something bigger than ourselves.
