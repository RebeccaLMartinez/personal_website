This page highlights some of my work from classes and research. It includes data projects, fieldwork, and tools I‚Äôve used.


## üè´ School Projects

<details>
  <summary><strong>üí° Service Light Data Project</strong></summary>

**UCSB**
**Course:** ENVS 193DS ‚Äì Data Science for Environmental Studies  

I explored the relationship between lighting conditions and service calls using a custom dataset of 108 observations. Deliverables included bar charts, a summary table, and a blinking lightboard animation.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Tools</strong></summary>
  RStudio (tidyverse, here, flextable, janitor, ggtext, ggfx, gganimate, showtext), Quarto

  <summary><strong>Reflection</strong></summary>

<blockquote>
  ‚ÄúIt requires you to actually <em>think</em> about your data.‚Äù ‚Äì An Bui
</blockquote>

This project made me think harder about data than I expected. After attempting to collect AND use my own data, I am humbled. Lessons were learned. Tears were shed.

  <summary><strong> Example Code</strong></summary>

```r
# Clean and standardize help and working columns
clean_service_data <- service_data |>  # using service_data set
  mutate(
    help = toupper(help),
    working = toupper(working),
    # Convert the uppercase text to logical TRUE/FALSE values
    help = as.logical(help), 
    working = as.logical(working)
  )
```
