## 🏫 School Projects

####  Current

  <summary><strong>💡 Service Light Data Project</strong></summary>

**Course:** ENVS 193DS – Data Science for Environmental Studies  

<details>
    <summary><strong>**Tools**</strong></summary>
    RStudio (tidyverse, here, flextable, janitor, ggtext, ggfx, gganimate, showtext), Quarto  
</details>

I explored the relationship between lighting conditions and service calls using a custom dataset of 108 observations. Deliverables included bar charts, a summary table, and a blinking lightboard animation.

    <summary><strong>**Reflection**</strong></summary>
<blockquote>
  “It requires you to actually <em>think</em> about your data.” – An Bui
</blockquote>

This project made me think harder about data than I expected. After attempting to collect AND use my own data, I am humbled. Lessons were learned. Tears were shed.

    <summary><strong>💻 Example Code</strong></summary>
    
Code for cleaning data:

```r

clean_service_data <- service_data |>  # using service_data set
  mutate(
    help = toupper(help),
    working = toupper(working),
    # Convert the uppercase text to logical TRUE/FALSE values
     help = as.logical(help), 
    working = as.logical(working))
```
