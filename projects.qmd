## 💡 Service Light Data Project

**Course:** ENVS 193DS  

As part of *Data Science for Environmental Studies* at UCSB, I explored the relationship between lighting conditions and service calls using a custom dataset of 108 observations. This included bar charts, a summary table, and a blinking lightboard animation.

### Reflection
This project was eye-opening. It was my first soft attempt at collecting and using my own data. Lessons were learned. Tears were shed. I will forever think more critically about my data.
