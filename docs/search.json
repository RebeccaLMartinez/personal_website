I started my academic journey at community college, where I reconnected with my love for science and service. Now, as an Environmental Studies major at UCSB, I’m combining research, search, and community engagement into a path that feels both meaningful and practical.\nphoto photo"

Over the years, I’ve stayed involved with efforts that reflect those values, like Toys for Tots, campus and local outreach, and She Raised Her Hand.\nTo me, meaningful work is about showing up — and trusting that what we offer contributes to something bigger than ourselves.\nphoto photo\nPlease visit She Raised Her Hand for more information and upcoming events.\nIf you’d like to support seasonal giving efforts, donations can be made through Toys for Tots."
