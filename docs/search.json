    "text": "💡 Service Light Data Project\nCourse: ENVS 193DS\nAs part of Data Science for Environmental Studies at UCSB, I explored the relationship between lighting conditions and service calls using a custom dataset of 108 observations. This included bar charts, a summary table, and a blinking lightboard animation.\n\n\n\nAnimated blinking lightboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Links\n\n\n\n\n📁 GitHub Repository\n\n🌐 Rendered HTML Output\n\n\n\n\n\nTools + Skills\n\nTools: R (ggplot2, dplyr, gganimate), Quarto, Adobe Photoshop\n\nSkills: Data cleaning, animation, visual storytelling, spatial reasoning\n\n\n\n\nDataset Overview\n\ndate – Date of the call\n\ntime_interval – Time block of the call\n\nhelp – Whether help was needed\n\nworking – Whether the light worked\n\nevent – Event nearby (e.g., holiday, show)\n\nmachines_active, staff_total, weekday\n\n\n\n\nArtist Statement (Excerpt)\nThis project shows service lights as a grid, using colors to show if they were working, broken, or unknown. It also uses symbols to show if help was needed. I was inspired by lightboards, slot machines, and visualizations that use color, or lack thereof, to represent data in unique ways. I made this using R code, with tools like ggplot, gganimate, and ggfx. The final result is an animated GIF. I cleaned my data and grouped each light by status. I gave each one a color and symbol, then added animation to make the working lights blink and glow.\n\n\n\nReflection\nThis project was eye-opening. It was my first soft attempt at collecting and using my own data. Lessons were learned. Tears were shed. I will forever think more critically about my data."
