    "text": "Hi! I’m Rebecca — an Environmental Studies major at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), student researcher, and mom of two incredible teenagers. I’ve taken an unconventional path to college, but every step has shaped who I am today. I’m passionate about hands-on learning and finding meaningful ways to connect science with the world around us.\n\n\n🛤️ My Path\nBefore returning to school, I balanced work, family life, and five years serving in the Marine Corps Reserves. Community college rekindled my love for science and service. At Allan Hancock College, I worked as a tutor and mentor, helping other students as I grew in my own studies. Now at UCSB, I’m blending research, education, and community involvement to build a path that feels purposeful and rewarding.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce Upon a Time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllan Hancock College.\n\n\n\n\n\n× \n\n\n\n\n\n\n🌿 Learning by Doing\nSometimes the best way to learn is by jumping in and experiencing it firsthand. Fieldwork brings my studies to life by connecting science with real environments and showing how those environments impact our world. I believe hands-on experience is one of the best ways to inspire students and anyone who’s still finding their place in science.\n\n\n\n\nHarvesting lavender to distill into oil.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Kayla Geronimo-Anctil on Santa Cruz Island Reserve.\n\n\n\nYou can explore my projects and photos pages to see what I’ve been up to.\n\n\n\n👩‍👧‍👦 Life & Inspiration\nI’m a proud mom of two amazing teenagers who inspire me every day. When I’m not studying or working, I enjoy volunteering, spending time outdoors, and relaxing with my cats, Chester and Leo.\n\n\n\n\nMy Family.\n\n\n\n\n\nChester and Leo.\n\n\n\nCurious about Chester and Leo? You can find more fluffiness here.\n\n\n\n❤️ Giving Back\nGiving back has always been a priority for me. Whether mentoring, volunteering, or supporting community efforts behind the scenes, I believe showing up and contributing makes a difference. Over the years, I’ve been involved with groups like Toys for Tots, local outreach, and She Raised Her Hand.\n\n\n\n\nToys for Tots Event (holding the unicorn).\n\n\n\n\n\nProclamation presented by the City of Santa Maria to She Raised Her Hand.\n\n\n\nPlease visit She Raised Her Hand for more information and upcoming events.\nIf you’d like to support seasonal giving efforts, donations can be made through Toys for Tots."
