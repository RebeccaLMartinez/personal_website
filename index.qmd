# Hi, and welcome!

I’m Rebecca Martinez — a student researcher and environmental studies major based in California. My work spans field science, , and educational outreach, with a focus on projects that connect people to place and data to impact.

This site highlights the projects I’m working on, the experiences shaping my academic path, and the ways I stay involved beyond the classroom. Whether you’re here to browse, collaborate, or just learn more, I’m glad you stopped by.

*Note: Some sections are still in progress as I add new content. Thanks for your patience!*
