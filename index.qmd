Welcome to the digital habitat of Rebecca Martinez — where curiosity leads the way and muddy boots are just part of the journey.  

This space is a growing collection of projects, fieldwork, adventures, and the occasional feline cameo. Whether it’s research, reflections, or unexpected detours, it’s all part of the exploration.

Feel free to wander, stay curious — and thanks for visiting.
