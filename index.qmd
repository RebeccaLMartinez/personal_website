I’m Rebecca Martinez — a student researcher and environmental studies major based in California. 

This site highlights the projects I’m working on, the experiences shaping my academic path, and the ways I stay involved beyond the classroom. Whether you’re here to browse, collaborate, or just learn more, I’m glad you stopped by!
